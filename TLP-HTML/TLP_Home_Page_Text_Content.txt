<p>The Loving Paw is a small, Arizona based organization dedicated to raising awareness about animal adoption and its many benefits. Millions of animals are euthanized every year due to overcrowding and a lack of resources to properly care for the high volume.</p>
<p>Through the efforts of various animal adoption groups, that number has decreased dramatically in recent years (20 million yearly down to 4 million!) but there's still a long road ahead.  We believe that every voice speaking on behalf of pet adoption counts towards getting to our goal of rescuing every animal possible.</p>
