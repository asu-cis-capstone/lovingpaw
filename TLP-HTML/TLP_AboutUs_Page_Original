<p>OUR MISSION:</p>
<p>We are dedicated to giving back to animal rescue organizations around the country. Our mission is to promote animal rescue &amp; make sure each pet feels special with a unique, customizable tag!  All of our tags &amp; gifts are created with pets, especially those fabulous rescues, in mind.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE OWNER:</p>
<p>My name is Alexis Enright. In 2010, I rescued my first dog. My experience at the animal shelter was something I will never forget – not just because I welcomed Cocoa into my life, but because it was there that I learned how many animals are uncared for and often euthanized. </p>
<p>Rather than sit with this realization, I became an avid supporter of animal rescue and started The Loving Paw in 2012. TLP is a small retail company consisting of custom pet tags, pet-parent jewelry, and an apparel line to promote pet adoption.  My husband Barry and I travel across the country for his baseball career with our two rescue dogs Cocoa &amp; Maddie. Barry &amp; I are ambassadors for Athletes for Animals and are committed to creating a platform to raise awareness on pet adoption and animal-related issues.</p>
