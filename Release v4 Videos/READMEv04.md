# LovingPaw

v0.4 Retrospective

For this release, we were finally able to meet with out client again to go over her likes and disklikes of our work so far and 
makes the finishing touches to go live.  We also took some time to go over how the project has grown and evolved from our
original design to wear we are now. 

Original site design

* imported products and links as is
* minimal design without much visual appeal
* Analytics involved using AdWords and an email campaign

New Design

* Redesigned logo to appear more professional
* Soft green and blue color scheme to add visual appeal
* Addtion of news, events and resources pages to enhance user experience
* Analytics campaigns will now focus on social media

The organic growth of the site has gone from a primarily ecommerce site to one to a social community site with an ecommerce
function.  The look and feel has been redesigned to be more appealing to The Loving Paw audience.  The site is ready to go live 
with Analytics tracking to begin.
