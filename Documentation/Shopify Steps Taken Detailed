                                Site-build steps taken:
1) Created admin account using the capstone440@gmail account. 

2) Applied the "New Standard" theme from Shopify's theme shop.

3) made modification to product.liquid in the "theme editor" (Admin/Themes/Customize Theme/Edit HTML/CSS/Templates/product.liquid) from the admin panel to add collapsable engraving text field should
a customer choose to add customizations to a qualifying Tag Line ID. Followed the following tutorial : 
http://the-new-standard-theme.myshopify.com/blogs/tutorials/6388020-using-line-item-properties-to-add-an-engraving-option-to-a-product

4) Also incorporated, from following the above-referenced tutorial, a new liquid file in the "theme editor" section (Admin/Themes/Customize Theme/Edit HTML/CSS/Templates/product.liquid)
to implement the benefits in step 3 (i.e. the collapsable customization field) more easily in future implementations. Should there
be an addition of products with qualifying customizations, this new file, titled "product.monogram.liquid" will act as a "template"
giving the product page the benefits from step 3. Validation via HTML5 coding, was incorporated to make entries into the collapsable
field mandatory upon selection of a customization.

5) Working currently on defaulting product pages to display a "select an option" for drop-down menus in lieu of auto-selecting
an option for the customer. used tutorial located at: http://docs.shopify.com/support/your-website/themes/how-to-add-a-pick-an-option-to-drop-downs

                                Could not get #5 working. Will postpone for later time.

6) Migrated tag-line ID's and connected all possible user selections currently supported in Etsy to 2 Tag-Line ID templates
usable within Shopify. Differences in their use, is explained below. All steps taken have been noted so as to provide a 
walk-through to TLP. 

7) Imported all Tag-Line-ID products. Utilized 2 templates, product.monogram.liquid, and product.nameandnumberstandard.liquid.
The use of these templates is for future ease in adding products with, and without standard stamping options. Manipulating premium
options is much easier done from the master template, but with few tags with standard name and number stamping, different templates
were warranted.

8) Imported all items in the T-Shirt category from etsy into the Shopify platform using the standard product.liquid theme in
Shopify. Sizes and inventory levels were transferred as well. *Check with TLP if inventory levels from Etsy were absolute, or 
if inventory levels differ from current levels.

9) In Progress: Importing remaining products and deciding on utilizing/modifying current templates to accomodate. Will discuss
options with the group following class on 2/5/15 before proceeding.
