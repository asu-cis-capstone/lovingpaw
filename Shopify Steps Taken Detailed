                                Site-build steps taken:
1) Created admin account using the capstone440@gmail account. 

2) Applied the "New Standard" theme from Shopify's theme shop.

3) made modification to product.liquid in the "theme editor" (Admin/Themes/Customize Theme/Edit HTML/CSS/Templates/product.liquid) from the admin panel to add collapsable engraving text field should
a customer choose to add customizations to a qualifying Tag Line ID. Followed the following tutorial :

4) Also incorporated, from following the above-referenced tutorial, a new liquid file in the "theme editor" section (Admin/Themes/Customize Theme/Edit HTML/CSS/Templates/product.liquid)
to implement the benefits in step 3 (i.e. the collapsable customization field) more easily in future implementations. Should there
be an addition of products with qualifying customizations, this new file, titled "product.monogram.liquid" will act as a "template"
giving the product page the benefits from step 3. Validation via HTML5 coding, was incorporated to make entries into the collapsable
field mandatory upon selection of a customization.
