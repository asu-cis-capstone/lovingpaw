v0.3 User Testing

Because the Shopify software virtually guarantees functionality, our user testing was primarily concerned with site features 
users would like to see as well as stylistic choices.

* "About Us" page picutre and information
* Shopping Cart setup and site pervasiveness
* Product Photos

User dislikes

* Features are not justified the same
* Lack of distinction between site sections and illogical navigation
* What does she do?

Changes

* Analytics campaign is already being planned using Google Analytics and Mail Chimp
